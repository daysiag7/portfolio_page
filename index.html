                <p>
                Hi, I am Daysi Garcia. I am currently an apprentice at American Express as a Junior Software Engineer. <br>
                I first took an intrest in Software Enginnering about one year ago when looking at returning to college for my second year. <br>
                When not really knowing what I wanted to study, I came across Computer Science and set forward to teach myself how to code using free resources online. <br>
                That is when I came across Multiverse, joined, and have been blessed with this amazing oppurtunity as a Junior Software Engineer. <br>
                Prior to this position, I was as a customer service representative at a healthcare. This new enviornment has been very different, but amazing!<br>
                This is the beginning of my coding journey and I can't wait to see what I am able to work on and accomplish!
